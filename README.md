# Tip-Calculator
If you are looking for a program to calculate your tips or you are simply interested in knowing how to develop a simple calculator that can do it, this small web system can help you.  
**This program has been developed using web technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)**.  

Before the program performs any calculation, the bill amount field is validated. The user will see a message indicating that the field needs to be filled in with a bill amount, in case the calculate button has been pressed with an empty bill amount field.  
This tip calculator allows you to calculate the amount you want to give to one or more people based on the selected percentage of the bill amount. If the tips are for only one person, once calculated the user will be able to see the tip amount and the total of the bill and if it is for more than one person, the user will be able to see the amount of tips per person, total per person and the total of the bill.  I hope you enjoy this system and found what you were looking for.
