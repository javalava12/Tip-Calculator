# Tip-Calculator
If you are looking for a program to calculate your tips or you are simply interested in knowing how to develop a simple calculator that can do it, this small web system can help you.  
**This program has been developed using web technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)**.  

Before the program performs any calculation, the bill amount field is validated. The user will see a message indicating that the field needs to be filled in with a bill amount, in case the calculate button has been pressed with an empty bill amount field.  
 
I hope you enjoy this system and found what you were looking for.
